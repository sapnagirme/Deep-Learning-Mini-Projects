# ü§ñ Deep Learning Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of deep learning mini projects exploring key concepts such as activation functions, regularization, data augmentation, transfer learning, sequence-to-sequence models, autoencoders, and GANs. Each project is implemented in Colab notebooks with step-by-step code, visual outputs, and concise explanations.

## üìÇ Projects Included

- **Activation Functions** ‚Äì `Activation_Function.ipynb`  
  Compare the performance of Sigmoid, Tanh, and ReLU activation functions in a neural network for image classification (e.g., MNIST).

- **Image Denoising with Autoencoders** ‚Äì `Image_Denoising.ipynb`  
  Train a denoising autoencoder to clean noisy images and visually compare outputs.

- **Image Generation with DCGANs** ‚Äì `Image_Genration_with_DCGAN.ipynb`  
  Use a Deep Convolutional GAN to generate synthetic images and evaluate them against real ones.

- **Machine Translation (Seq2Seq)** ‚Äì `Machine_Translation.ipynb`  
  Implement a sequence-to-sequence model using LSTMs to translate English to French using a custom dataset (`small_vocab_en`, `small_vocab_fr`).

- **Regularization Techniques** ‚Äì `Regularization_Techniques.ipynb`  
  Apply L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization to deep learning models. Analyze their impact on overfitting and underfitting.

- **Transfer Learning** ‚Äì `Transfer_Learning.ipynb`  
  Fine-tune a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16) on a custom image classification task with limited data.
